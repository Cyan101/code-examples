Elixir strays away from Ruby a fair bit, even though it is inspired by it

Cant do stuff like making a variable (eg. rawr = "hi") and then doing rawr.length, you need to call String.length and then give it rawr
Half confused because you can do length [1,2,3] and it will output the length

When talking about functions in elixir it looks like people do hd/1 or tl/1 which I think means it takes in 1 variable?
Compared to Ruby devs where we just say #length or #uppercase

Immutability was a confusing thing for me, I was told it helps with writing nice code but it also keeps variables and stuff SAFE!
This is what got me, variables CAN be overwritten and replaced, so I was confused at how this keeps variables and data safe.
Turns out I was looking at it the wrong way, after talking with another elixir dev I managed to figure out what it actually meant.


From my discord chat:

I'm confused
Immutable keeps variables and data safe by not letting you change them, but you can reassign variables which basically
overwrites them and you lose the old data.... So it's not safe?
Sorry if I'm overthinking

Elixir Dev 420 -
you are lol
it's all about the data itself
not the variable it's assigned to

Cyan -
So it's more
You can't fuck the data
Not you can't lose the data
?

Elixir Dev 420 -
yep

So it basically means your data is safe from being edited or messed with or just changed in any way,
but its not safe from being replaced or overwritten with new data
