# Cases are pretty much the same as most languages except we get to draw cool arrows
case {1, 2, 3} do
  {4, 5, 6} ->
    "This clause won't match"
  {1, x, 3} ->
    "This clause will match and bind x to 2 in this clause"
  _ ->
    "This clause would match any value"
end

# Cases can also have "Guards" aka. extra matching
case {1, 2, 3} do
  {1, x, 3} when x > 0 ->
    "Will match"
  _ ->
    "Would match, if guard condition were not satisfied"
end
# This will only match when `x` is positive
